1.3.5
- switched back to port 80 instead of 10080 when querying temperature data from Toon:
  http://127.0.0.1/happ_thermstat?action=getThermostatInfo

1.3.3/1.3.4
- firmware 5 comtatibility

1.3.2
- now compatible with firmware 4.16.8 (up and down arrows now shown ongraph)
- no need to update on older firmwares

1.3.1
- changed save location for readings, was previously deleted after a full reboot.
  Data is now persistent with a gui-restart as well as a full reboot.
- bug fix: now also saving the Y-scale settings.
  data was not displayed properly after a reboot without it
- small code optimizations

1.3.0
- manually adjustable Y-axis
- save measurement data to be available again after a restart
- code optimizations

1.2.2
- rebranded for Toonstore

1.2.1
- cosmetic changes to systray icon

1.2
- added a third graph with outdoor temperatures taken from buienradar.
  in order to see this data the buienradar app must be installed as well (version 8.0.5 or higher)
  also the time from the buienradar file is used, meaning that this graph is always updated 10-20 minutes later then the room temperature and program temperature. 

1.0
- no reading and writing of the 24h values anymore to a temporary file before and after each reading .
 Full table is kept in ram only. Only disadvantage: when the qt gui restarts all data from the last 24h is lost but will be build-up again of course
- y-axis scale is now 12-28 degrees instead of 0-32 before, which makes it much more easier to read specific values
- javascript module simplified
- all unused elements/functions removed from the AreaGraphMod.qml
- temperatureLoggerApp.qml simplified significantly.

0.1
- first functional release showing actual room temperature and program temperature for the last 24 hours
